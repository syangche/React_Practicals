This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## File Upload 
This is an implementation of a file upload feature in React and Next.js, demonstrating best practices for multipart form handling, file validation, progress tracking, and drag-and-drop interfaces. It provides both frontend React components and API routes for backend functionality.

ðŸš€ Features

âœ… Multipart form data handling

âœ… File type validation (JPEG, PNG, PDF)

âœ… File size restrictions (5MB limit)

âœ… Upload progress tracking

âœ… Drag and drop interface

âœ… Preview for image uploads

âœ… Multiple file upload support

âœ… Serverless API route for file storage

 ### Key dependencies include:

`react-hook-form` for form management

`react-dropzone` for drag and drop functionality

`axios` for HTTP requests with progress tracking

`formidable` for parsing multipart form data on the server

ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites
